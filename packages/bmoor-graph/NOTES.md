I wanted to encode 'iterations' as a first class concept in the graph, where you could say 'run these stats with only the data before this iteration.  For now, I'll just expect a graph to be written for each iteration, I'll work on making if a first class later.  It feels like too much for little gain when the same functionality can be duplicated in a combersome, but simple way.
