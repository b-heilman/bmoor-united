Using football as a working example:
- I want to be able to order the games (events) and calculate estimates for nodes as the season moves forward
- I want to be able to roll player positions into node features for each week, so they can be used for pregame comparisons
- Pregame comparisons will be done via event + nodes.  Event will give weather and condition variables, nodes with give comparable features.
- Postgame results go on the events, to be used in future calculations
